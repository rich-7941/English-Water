## What is water pressure?

Water pressure refers to the force exerted by water as it moves through the pipes, influencing the strength of the flow coming out of your tap.

## What should I do if I have a problem with water pressure?

If you’re experiencing low water pressure, first check for plumbing issues within your property, such as a partially closed internal stop tap or a leak.

## What else can affect your water pressure?

Modern heating appliances and showers often require a certain pressure level to function properly. Before installing such equipment, consult your water company to ensure that the pressure in your area is sufficient for these systems.

## No water or low water pressure?

Our checklist explains the potential reasons for no water or low pressure and how to address these issues.

When you turn on your taps, you should expect the water pressure to be strong enough to fill a glass or kettle easily. If the pressure drops to a trickle or stops completely, don’t panic.

## What to do if you have low water pressure

If you don’t have a strong enough flow of water coming through your taps, try these steps to increase your water pressure:

1. **Locate your internal stop tap:** Your stop tap might be in a kitchen cupboard near the sink, close to your front door, in an airing cupboard, or near your water meter (if inside your house). Once you locate your stop tap, turn it off completely.

2. **Turn on your cold tap:** Fully turn on the cold water tap in your kitchen. Some residual water might flow out for a few seconds before it stops.

3. **Turn your internal stop tap back on:** Turn the stop tap back on. There may be a brief surge as the airlock clears, after which the water should return to normal pressure.

4. **Further checks:** Besides your main stop tap, ensure any other taps controlling flow to your hot water system or other devices are turned on. If you have a thermostatic shower, check if the thermostat needs adjusting.

5. **Check your house for leaks:** Inspect your home for any leaking pipes that could cause a drop in pressure. Refer to our guide for locating household leaks.

If you still experience low water pressure or have little to no running water, it might be due to a water supply pipe leak that needs replacement. Find a local water industry-approved plumber on WaterTrust.
