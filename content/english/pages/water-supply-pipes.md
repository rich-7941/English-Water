# Water supply pipes

If you suspect that your water supply pipe might need repair or replacement on your property, the following advice can assist you in finding the right solution. You may have noticed a leak or experienced low water flow or pressure, or you might be renovating, and itâ€™s time to replace old lead pipes.

## Signs of a damaged water supply pipe

The flow of water into your property depends on the condition of your water supply pipe. If your water supply pipe is in poor condition, the amount of water it carries could be restricted, thereby reducing the flow of water to your taps. This can be caused by:

- The diameter of the water supply pipe
- Corrosion in the water supply pipe
- The demand for water in your home at a particular time
- A leak in your water supply pipe
- The pressure in the water main
- Any inconsistencies, such as a partly shut stop tap

## Lead water supply pipe

If your house was built before 1970 and has not been modernised, it is likely that your water supply pipe is made of lead.

If you have a lead water supply pipe, it is recommended to run the cold tap for a few moments before filling your glass to flush out any settled water in the pipe. If the water has been standing in the lead water supply pipe for a long time, such as overnight or during a holiday, the concentration of lead in the standing water will be higher. Flushing it through before use will decrease the concentration.

If you are concerned about lead in your water or want to modernise your property, consider replacing your water supply pipe.

## Water supply pipe leak

If you have a water supply pipe leak, the best solution is to replace the water supply pipe. This is because the water supply pipe will be as old as the property itself, which could be over five decades or even a century old and beyond its useful lifespan.

Patch repairs on old water supply pipes usually result in further leaks as the water pressure is restored, causing the next weakest part of the pipe to burst and require another patch repair.

These costs can quickly add up and can easily exceed the cost of a water supply pipe replacement.
