## Water Supply Pipe Replacement

If you suspect that your water supply pipe might need repair or replacement on your property, the following advice can assist you in finding the right solution.

You may have noticed a leak, experienced low water flow or pressure, or you might be renovating and it's time to replace old lead pipes. If you are replacing the water supply pipe on your property, you will also need to inform your water supplier, as they may need to replace or modify their part of the water supply pipe too.

## Signs of a Damaged Water Supply Pipe

### Low Flow

The flow of water into your property depends on the condition of your water supply pipe. If your water supply pipe is in poor condition, the amount of water it carries could be restricted, thereby reducing the flow of water to your taps. This can be caused by:

- The diameter of the water supply pipe
- Corrosion in the water supply pipe
- The demand for water in your home at a particular time
- A leak in your water supply pipe
- The pressure in the water main
- Any inconsistencies, such as a partly shut stop tap

### Lead Water Supply Pipe

If your house was built before 1970 and has not been modernised, it is likely that your water supply pipe is made of lead.

If you have a lead water supply pipe, it is recommended to run the cold tap for a few moments before filling your glass to flush out any settled water in the pipe. If the water has been standing in the lead water supply pipe for a long time, such as overnight or during a holiday, the concentration of lead in the standing water will be higher. Flushing it through before use will decrease the concentration.

If you are concerned about lead in your water or want to modernise your property, consider replacing your water supply pipe.

### Water Supply Pipe Leak

If you have a water supply pipe leak, the best solution is to replace the water supply pipe. This is because the water supply pipe will be as old as the property itself, which could be over five decades or even a century old and beyond its useful lifespan.

Patch repairs on old water supply pipes usually result in further leaks as the water pressure is restored, causing the next weakest part of the pipe to burst and require another patch repair.

These costs can quickly add up and can easily exceed the cost of a water supply pipe replacement.

## Renovating Your Property?

Renovating is a good opportunity for water supply pipe replacement. If you are renovating an area of your home, this is a good time to inspect the newly exposed plumbing for any worrisome signs.

If the water supply pipe needs replacing, doing so while it is exposed for other work will save you money in the long run, as you won’t have to re-expose the water supply pipe for the replacement to take place.

This is especially important if you are having your driveway done - replacing your water supply pipe at the same time will save a lot of distress, as your driveway will need to be disrupted to access your water supply pipe if it is done at a later date.

## Choosing a Specialist

Water supply pipe replacement is a specialist job; therefore, we recommend choosing a WaterTrust-approved plumber.

This will ensure the work undertaken complies with UK Water Regulations and Byelaws, meets high standards, and protects the quality of drinking water in your home. If you’re planning to replace the underground water supply pipe from the external highway boundary up to the internal stop tap, you may require a specialist contractor.

WaterTrust-approved plumbers are certified to carry out new water supply pipe installations.
