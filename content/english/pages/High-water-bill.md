## High water bill

## Is your bill higher than normal?

If your bill is higher than usual, we know it can be worrying, which is why we're here to help you - there might be a simple explanation.

The most common cause of high bills is using lots of water. You may be using more water just by being at home more often than usual. Take a moment and think about the water you've used recently.

If you've been using the same amount of water as normal and are still worried about your bill, follow the three simple steps below to help identify the issue.

## Reasons for a higher bill

From hosepipes, sprinklers, and hot tubs to water-dependent appliances to taking more baths than showers, the litres can add up quickly.

The two most common reasons for a higher bill are estimated readings or simply using more water, such as:

- A growing family or guests staying
- New water-reliant appliances
- Home improvements
- Working from home
- Filling a pond, swimming pool, or hot tub

## Check for leaks

If you still think your bill is high, you may have a leak. It's important to regularly check for leaks in your home to avoid wasting water and causing your bill to increase.

A leaking toilet can waste up to 215 litres a day, which amounts to Â£200 a year.

If you've ruled out dripping taps and leaking toilets, then you may have a water supply pipe leak. Follow our advice on how to check for a water supply pipe leak.

If you find and fix a leak within 30 days, you may qualify for a leak allowance. You'll need to provide a meter reading after the repair and another reading two weeks later.
