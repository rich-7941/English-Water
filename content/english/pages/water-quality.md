## Water Quality

### What to Do if Your Water Looks Unusual

If your water appears discoloured, has particles in it, or seems cloudy, here's what might be causing the change and how to fix it.

#### Why Is My Water Cloudy/Discoloured?

There are many factors that can affect the appearance of your water during its journey through pipes, sometimes causing discolouration. The most common cause is a change in the flow or pressure within the water supply pipesâ€”for example, a burst main in your area. This change in pressure can dislodge tiny deposits, such as iron or manganese sediments, which may temporarily turn the water brown.

In most cases, water that is discoloured is not a cause for concern and can be cleared by running the cold kitchen tap at a steady flow until it clears.

#### Why Does My Water Have a Strange Taste/Smell?

Occasionally, customers report that their tap water suddenly has an unusual taste or odour. Below are the most common causes.

##### Chlorine/TCP/Bitter/Disinfectant/Medicinal

Water suppliers add small, carefully controlled amounts of chlorine at the treatment works to disinfect the water, and a residual is maintained throughout the distribution system to ensure it's safe to drink. Rest assured, chlorine isn't harmful in the quantities they add, and they aim to keep chlorine levels to a minimum.

The chlorine may be more noticeable on some occasions depending on factors such as the distance from the treatment works, the time it takes for the water to travel to your property, and the time of day.

If you notice strong TCP tastes or smells from your water, try the following:

- Check with your neighbours to see if they have the same problem.
- Make a note of which tap or fitting you were using when the problem started.
- If necessary, replace the washer or fittings.
- Rinse your kettle before use.
- If you suspect your kettle may be causing the taste, try boiling water in a saucepan and use this water to make your hot drinks.
- If you have a washing machine plumbed into the water mains in the kitchen, check it has a suitable non-return valve fitted so that water sitting in the hose over long periods is not drawn back.

##### Musty Tastes or Earthy Smells

Musty tastes or smells are often caused by water that has been left stagnant after periods of non-use. You may also experience a musty taste when cold water pipes pass near unlagged hot water pipes or radiators, where they can become warm. Running your tap for a few minutes brings through fresh, cold water.

##### Metallic Tastes

Copper, iron, or galvanised water supply pipes that have corroded can produce a metallic or bitter taste.

If the water has been standing in the water supply pipe for several hours, fill a washing-up bowl with water to draw fresh water through the pipe. Top tip: The water in the bowl can then be used for watering your garden plants, so it's not wasted.

#### Lead Pipes

If your property was built before 1970, you may have a lead water supply pipe. Since then, it has been illegal to build new homes using lead fittings or pipes for water supply, but some older homes may still have lead water supply pipes.

There are a few ways to tell if you have a lead water supply pipe:

- Unpainted lead water supply pipes are a dull grey colour and have swollen, rounded joints where they meet other pipes.
- Lead is a soft metal, so if you tap a lead water supply pipe with a metal object, like a coin, you will hear a dull thud rather than a clear ringing like you would with a harder copper or iron pipe.

##### What to Do If You Have a Lead Water Pipe

If you have lead water supply pipes, replacing them is the only way to eliminate lead from your drinking water. However, there are ways to reduce the likelihood of exposure to lead in your water:

- Run the taps before using any water for cooking or drinking. Flushing through any water that has been standing in the pipes for several hours will mean the water you use is less likely to have absorbed lead.
- Boiling water will not remove the lead from it.
- If you have a lead water supply pipe, you can replace it with a modern MDPE pipe using a WaterTrust-approved plumber.
