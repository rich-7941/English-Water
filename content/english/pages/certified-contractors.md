# Certified contractors

Find a reputable, trustworthy water contractor for your needs. We always recommend selecting a certified WaterTrust contractor. Anyone carrying out plumbing work in your home must ensure that your drinking water remains clean and safe.

All pipework and fittings that are part of your water supply system should comply with the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999. Property owners, occupiers, and anyone working on the plumbing system have a legal duty to ensure the work meets these regulations.

Therefore, we recommend choosing a contractor who is a member of WaterTrust. Using a WaterTrust certified contractor provides the following benefits:

● Certified contractors are qualified to carry out water supply work in homes and business premises, ensuring compliance with the Water Fittings Regulations. This reduces the risk of contamination from substandard installations or uncertified materials.

● They will issue a certificate for their work, confirming compliance with UK Water Regulations.

● Certified contractors can carry out work without providing advance notification to your water supplier.

● Certified businesses hold employers and public liability insurance.

● A complaints procedure is in place to resolve disputes about the work.

● Certified businesses must rectify their work if it fails to meet the Water Fittings Regulations enforced by the water supplier.

● Certified businesses are audited to ensure they comply with the scheme’s rules.

Specialist water contractors certified by WaterTrust are recommended to work on the underground pipe supplying your property up to the internal stop tap. They have the necessary skills, knowledge, experience, and training to work on water supply pipes within your property boundary in accordance with regulations.

Your water supply pipe could be decades old, and if one section has a problem, other sections will likely be of similar age and condition. Therefore, you may experience more problems in the future if you only patch-repair the water supply pipe. The best advice is to replace the water supply pipe.

While the initial cost of replacing the damaged water supply pipe with a new one is often more expensive, it could save you money in the long run by avoiding multiple repairs.

When a leak or burst pipe happens on your property, it can be stressful. It’s essential to find someone trustworthy and reputable to help. By using a certified contractor, you can be assured that the business you contact holds the correct qualifications, training, and Public and Employers Liability Insurance.
