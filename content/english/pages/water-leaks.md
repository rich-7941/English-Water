# Water leaks

Leaks within or on your property are your responsibility. Our comprehensive guide provides advice on what to do when you encounter a leak at home. This includes identifying leaks, checking pipe responsibility, and arranging repairs.

It’s essential to locate any leaks promptly as they can cause further damage to your home, such as subsidence. If you have a meter, you’re also paying for the leaking water, so repairing the leak can reduce your bill.

## What to do if you think you have a water leak

Sometimes, a leak isn’t immediately obvious but can silently waste water and cost you money. If you suspect a leak, here are some indicators to watch for:

- Water where there usually isn’t any
- Reduced water pressure in your home
- Damp patches on the ground
- Noisy pipework
- A significant increase in your meter reading or bill
- A particularly lush patch of grass or plants, especially during dry weather

## Finding a leak in your home

There aren’t always clear signs of a leak, such as a damp patch or water bubbling up from the ground in your garden. Sometimes you have to investigate. Follow this simple checklist to help you find a water leak in your house.

1. **Find your water meter**

   Your water meter is usually outside your home, under a small metal or plastic cover embedded in the pavement near the property. It might also be in your garden.

2. **Turn off or stop using appliances**

   Ensure that anything that normally draws water from your pipework is not in use. This includes appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers, as well as toilet cisterns and water tanks. Otherwise, you won’t be able to detect a leak.

3. **Wait 15 minutes**

   After checking your appliances, wait 15 minutes to ensure nothing in your home is still consuming water.

4. **Check your water meter**

   Check your meter. If the meter dial is moving, then there may be a leak somewhere in the pipework.

5. **Carry out a simple stop tap test**

   Locate your internal stop tap (usually under the stairs, kitchen sink, or in the basement) and turn it off. Try running your kitchen tap to ensure the stop tap is off—there should be no running water. Then, check your water meter. If the red dial is moving, there might be a leak between the meter and the stop tap on your water supply pipe.

6. **If the red dial is not moving**

   If the red dial is not moving, there might be an issue in the pipework or plumbing inside your home. This is your responsibility, so you’ll need to call a certified contractor to fix the problem.

If you are a tenant, it’s your landlord’s responsibility to find and repair the leak. Please inform them if you have a leak.

If the leak is outside your home but still on your property, you’ll need the services of a specialist water contractor. They can carry out water supply pipe replacements, which are always recommended as patch repairs are prone to leak again.

These contractors are WaterTrust certified, a mark of their expertise and commitment to quality. They work in compliance with UK Byelaws and Water Fittings Regulations, ensuring that your leak is handled professionally and in line with water industry standards.
