# Low pressure or no water

Water pressure is the force exerted by water as it moves through pipes, determining the strength of the flow from your taps.

If you notice low water pressure, start by checking for plumbing issues within your property. Common culprits include a partially closed internal stop tap or a leak.

Modern heating appliances and showers often require a specific pressure level to function properly. When you turn on your taps, you should expect the water pressure to be strong enough to fill a glass or kettle quickly. If the pressure drops to a trickle or stops altogether, don’t panic.

## What to do if you have low water pressure

If you don’t have a strong enough flow of water coming through your taps, try these steps to increase your water pressure:

1. **Locate your internal stop tap:** Your stop tap might be in a kitchen cupboard near the sink, close to your front door, in an airing cupboard, or near your water meter (if inside your house). Once you locate your stop tap, turn it off completely.

2. **Turn on your cold tap:** Fully turn on the cold water tap in your kitchen. Some residual water might flow out for a few seconds before it stops.

3. **Turn your internal stop tap back on:** Turn the stop tap back on. There may be a brief surge as the airlock clears, after which the water should return to normal pressure.

4. **Further checks:** Besides your main stop tap, ensure any other taps controlling flow to your hot water system or other devices are turned on. If you have a thermostatic shower, check if the thermostat needs adjusting.

5. **Check your house for leaks:** Inspect your home for any leaking pipes that could cause a drop in pressure. Refer to our [guide for locating household leaks](/water-leaks).

If you still experience low water pressure or have little to no running water, it might be due to a water supply pipe leak that needs replacement.
