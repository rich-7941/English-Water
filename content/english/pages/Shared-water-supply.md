## Shared water supply

Modern homes typically have their own dedicated water supply pipe. However, some older properties may be connected to a shared water supply pipe. This setup means a single pipe from your water supplier's mains splits into multiple pipes that enter each property. Homeowners with shared water supply pipes are collectively responsible for maintaining them. Shared water supply pipes can be problematic in terms of responsibility, as repairs often require agreement from all affected neighbours, depending on the location of the issue.

## Shared supply problems

Households on a shared water supply may notice a significant drop in water pressure when a neighbour uses water, affecting activities like showering. In some cases, one property may have a stopcock controlling the water supply for both houses. This shared stopcock can be inconvenient if insurance requires you to turn off your water supply while you're away, as it would impact your neighbour as well.

Future issues with water metering are also possible, and relationships with neighbours play a crucial role hereâ€”disagreements can exacerbate shared water supply issues, potentially turning them into long-term disruptions.

## Separate water supply pipe

The Water Industry Act 1991 states that water and sewerage companies must connect properties to their networks, giving you the right to a separate supply. However, you are responsible for the cost of running a new water supply pipe from the street mains to your property.

Unlike other utility connections, such as gas, the water supply pipe within your property's boundary is your responsibility.

Disputes over shared water supply pipes are civil matters, meaning your water supplier won't help resolve them. However, you can separate your supply from the shared pipework without your neighbours' permission.

The shared supply will continue to serve your neighbours and remain in place unless all connected properties arrange for individual supplies.

If you want to install a separate water supply pipe and are currently on a shared one, it is advisable to use a WaterTrust [certified contractor](/certified-contractors).
