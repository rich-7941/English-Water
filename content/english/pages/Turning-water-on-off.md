## Water sector overview

Every day, over 50 million household and non-household consumers in England and Wales receive good quality water, sanitation, and drainage services. These services are provided by privately-owned companies in England and Wales.

Since the water and sewerage industry was privatised in 1989, a regulatory framework has been in place to ensure that consumers receive high standards of service at a fair price. This framework has allowed the companies to invest more than Â£130 billion in maintaining and improving assets and services. The industry must also comply with relevant legislation.
