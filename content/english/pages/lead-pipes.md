# Lead pipes

Lead has been used for plumbing since Roman times. If your house was built before 1970, there is a good chance you may have a lead water supply pipe.

Lead is extremely toxic. A study of 1,300 children found that intelligence decreased as lead levels in the blood increased. Surprisingly, lead water supply pipes are still used to deliver drinking water in many UK homes without the homeowners' knowledge.

Serious health problems can be caused by exposure to low levels of lead. Lead is particularly harmful to young children and unborn babies if exposed to significant quantities. Lead levels in drinking water must be kept as low as possible. It is also linked to behavioural and learning problems in children, as well as high blood pressure, kidney, heart, and circulatory health issues in adults.

Lead accumulates in the body, affecting every organ, particularly the nervous system, and has serious consequences for children’s brain development. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has found that low-level lead exposure can lead to reduced IQ and behavioural changes such as reduced attention spans.

Children under six who are exposed to lead have a higher chance of developing issues, including slowed growth, difficulty in school, lowered IQ, and even brain damage.

The WHO states there is no safe level of lead in water. In the UK, the Prescribed Concentration or Value (PCV) for lead in drinking water is 10 ppb (parts per billion). Water companies must ensure their supply is below this level.

A common misconception is that drinking water is safe if the amount of lead is below the drinking water standards. The WHO has advised that there is no safe limit for lead.

The UK water supply regulations in 1989 set the lead limit at 50 ppb. This was reduced to 25 ppb in 2003 and further to the current limit of 10 ppb in 2013. The European Parliament adopted the revised drinking water directive in 2020 that commits EU members to a limit of 5 ppb by 2036. The UK is likely to formally commit to a 5 ppb standard.

## What’s a water supply pipe?

When lead gets into tap water, it often happens right before it enters the home — through what is called a water supply pipe.

A water supply pipe is the underground pipe that carries water to your house from the water main on the road. Often, the part up to the property line is considered public and may have been replaced by your water supplier. The water supply pipe is considered private property and the homeowner’s responsibility.

## How do I know if I have a lead water supply pipe?

You can follow these simple steps to find out whether your drinking water is at risk. You only need a coin and a kitchen magnet. If you do find lead, we’ll advise on what you can do.

1. **Find your internal stop tap**: Locate where the water first comes into the property. This may be in or behind the cupboards in your kitchen or a downstairs toilet.

2. **Dull grey colour**: Unpainted lead water supply pipes appear dull grey and often have a swollen joint next to the tap.

3. **Lead is soft**: Gently scrape it with a coin, and you will see the shiny, silver-coloured metal beneath.

4. **Tap the water supply pipe with a metal object**: Lead makes a dull thud rather than the clear ringing produced by a copper or iron pipe.

5. **Magnetic**: If a magnet sticks to the water supply pipe, then it is likely to be a galvanised steel water supply pipe and not lead.

6. **Look at the joints**: Lead joints are rounded and swollen where two pipes meet.

Other water supply pipe materials in common use are:
- **Copper** – Hard and dull brown
- **Iron** – Very hard, dark and may be rusty
- **Plastic** – Typically blue, but if older, it may be black or grey

## How does lead get into drinking water?

Lead from water supply pipes can dissolve into the water while it stands in the pipe. Therefore, if you have a lead water supply pipe, there will likely be some lead in your drinking water. The concentration of lead may depend on the following:
- **How long the water has been standing in the lead water supply pipe**
- **The condition of the lead water supply pipe**
- **The temperature of the water**: More lead will dissolve during the summer and autumn months.
- **Water hardness**: Harder water tends to form a protective scale over the surface of the lead water supply pipe which can reduce the concentration of lead in the water.

For all these reasons, lead in drinking water at a particular property may be present, and if so, actions should be taken to reduce this as far as possible.

## How to reduce lead in your drinking water

For drinking and cooking, run the tap to clear any water that has been standing in the lead water supply pipe for a while, for example, overnight.

Running the tap for 2 minutes is normally enough to clear the lead water supply pipe of standing water, although if you have a long water supply pipe, you may need to run the tap for longer.

Check to see if you notice the temperature of the water drop as the mains water comes through (run the tap over your fingers, and you should notice the change of temperature as fresh mains water arrives). You can then use the kitchen tap as normal.

This short-term measure will protect you and your family, but if you have a lead water supply pipe, it should be replaced as soon as possible.

Never cook or mix instant formulas using water running through a lead water supply pipe.

You can collect the water you flush and put it to good use, such as watering your plants or washing your car.

Boiling your water might sterilise it, but it won't remove lead.

## Who is responsible for which pipes?

The communication pipe is the pipe that connects the water main in the street to your outside stop valve (usually on the public highway) and belongs to the water company.

The water supply pipe that leads from the outside stop valve to your property to the point where it enters your home is the responsibility of the owner.

## What should I do if I want to replace my lead water supply pipe?

If you have a lead water supply pipe, the only way to eliminate lead levels completely is to replace the pipe. If you are planning on replacing your lead water supply pipe, we recommend that you employ a water industry certified contractor to carry out the work accredited by WaterTrust.

When your lead water supply pipe has been replaced, your WaterTrust certified contractor will also notify your water supplier because they are then legally required to replace the communication pipe on the public highway at their expense if it is made of lead and is at risk of contributing to the amount of lead in the drinking water supply.
