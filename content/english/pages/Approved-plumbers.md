# Certified contractors

Find a reputable, trustworthy water contractor for your needs.

We always recommend that you select an approved WaterTrust contractor.

Anyone carrying out plumbing work in your home must ensure that your drinking water remains clean and safe to drink.

All pipework and fittings that are part of your water supply system should comply with the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999. Property owners, occupiers, and anyone working on the plumbing system have a legal duty to ensure the work meets these regulations. 

Therefore, we recommend you select a plumber who is a member of WaterTrust.

Using a WaterTrust-approved plumber will provide you with the following benefits:

● Certified contractors are qualified to carry out plumbing work in homes and business premises. They comply with the Water Fittings Regulations, ensuring there is no risk from substandard installation or uncertified materials that could contaminate your drinking water supply.

● They will issue a certificate for their work, certifying it complies with UK Water Regulations.

● Certified contractors can carry out work without providing advance notification to your water supplier.

● Approved businesses hold employers and public liability insurance.

● A complaints procedure is in place to resolve disputes about how the work has been carried out.

● Approved businesses must rectify their work if it fails to meet the Water Fittings Regulations enforced by the water supplier.

Approved businesses are audited to ensure they comply with the scheme's rules.

You should use a specialist water contractor to work on the underground pipe supplying your property up to the internal stop tap. These contractors are certified by the water industry to lay new pipes (also known as moling).

These contractors are approved WaterTrust plumbers to carry out this type of work in compliance with the Water Fittings Regulations and Byelaws.

You can be confident that they have the necessary skills, knowledge, experience, and training to work on water supply pipes within your property boundary in accordance with regulations.

Your water supply pipe could be decades old and, in some cases, even over a century in age. If one section of the pipe has a problem, other sections will likely be of similar age and condition, so you may experience more problems in the future if you only patch-repair the water supply pipe. Therefore, the best advice is to replace the water supply pipe.

While the initial cost of a relay—replacing the damaged water supply pipe with a new pipe—is often more expensive, it could save you money in the long run if you were to keep paying for multiple repairs.

When a leak or burst pipe happens on your property, it can be stressful, and it's essential you find someone trustworthy and reputable to help.

By using an approved Water Contractor, you can be assured that the contractor you contact holds the correct qualifications, training, and Public and Employers Liability Insurance.
